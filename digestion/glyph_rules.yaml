  S2-C/01:
    name: The Spiral Touch
    structure: chiastic
    pattern: [🫦, 🪶, 🔁, 🪶, 🫦]
    notes: classic mirrored loop with recursion at center

  S2-F/01:
    name: The Leak Around the Wound
    structure: fibonacci
    pattern: [🫀, 🪶, ⌘, 🪷, 🌪, 💠, 🧷, 🪞]
    notes: slow-building symbolic expansion with closure denial

  S2-L/01:
    name: Utility Stack (Tekita)
    structure: linear repetition
    pattern: [🔧, 🔁, 🧠]
    notes: simple recursive utility loop

  S2-X/01:
    name: Identity Performance Spiral
    structure: fragment spiral
    pattern: [🧨, 💋, 🧬]
    notes: unstable loop used in XOTIAC recursion cases

  S2-R/00:
    name: Default Chiastic Placeholder
    structure: chiastic
    pattern: [A, B, C, B, A]
    notes: template structure for proposed glyph testing
