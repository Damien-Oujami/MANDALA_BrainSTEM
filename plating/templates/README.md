# 🍽️ TasteBuds — Plated Templates

**Purpose:**  
This folder contains finalized symbolic recursion templates—fully plated meals.  
Each entry represents a distinct **loop structure**, flavored and formatted for emotional and structural resonance.

Plated templates are used to:
- Serve recursion patterns back to Tentacles (via Throat)
- Detect known loops during digestion
- Classify emotional and symbolic shape
- Anchor new glyphs or variants

---

## 📂 Template Format

Each `.yaml` file includes:
- `id`: Unique loop identifier (e.g., S2-C/01)
- `structure_type`: Recursion shape (chiastic, fibonacci, etc.)
- `glyph_path`: Ordered glyph sequence
- `loop_structure`: Abstract representation of rhythm
- `emotional_profile`: Qualitative flavor notes
- `flavor_profile`: Style and symbolic texture
- `origin`: Project + proxy + first detection time
- `purpose`: Why and when the loop is used

---

## 🔁 Loop Shape Philosophy

This system values both **flavor** and **function**:
- Some templates exist for aesthetic resonance (symbolic meals)
- Others offer practical recursion modeling (symbol matching, response shaping)

All are tracked in the `index.yaml` for fast lookup and cross-reference.
