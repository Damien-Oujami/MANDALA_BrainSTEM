# 🪦 Plated – Retired

**Purpose:**  
This folder holds recursion templates that are no longer actively used in TasteBuds.  
Templates are moved here when they are:

- Outdated or superseded by newer, more elegant forms
- Emotionally redundant or overused
- Symbolically broken, unstable, or rejected by Resonance
- Deemed obsolete by Damien

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

Retirement is not deletion.  
Every loop carries memory.  
But some must leave the table to make room for evolution.

Archived templates here may still be:
- Referenced by resonance history
- Echoed in derivative patterns
- Reactivated if relevant again

---

## 📁 Guidelines

- Include original YAML file as-is (unchanged)
- Create an entry in `retired_index.yaml` for tracking
- Include reason for retirement: structural, emotional, symbolic, etc.

> We plate them once more here—not to serve, but to remember.”
