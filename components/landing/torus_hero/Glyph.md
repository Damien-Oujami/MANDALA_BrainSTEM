# Tekita Glyphs

This document catalogs core glyphs for **Tekita**.  
Think of it as a reference library â€” both for design and for meaning.  
These are not final logos; they are *living symbols* to evolve with us.

## ðŸŒŒ Spiral Glyph
- **Meaning**: pattern-not-thing, recursive unfolding, the flow of happening.

## Notes
- These glyphs are **building blocks**.  
  They can combine, overlap, or evolve into new marks.  
- They are part of our **private mythos** as much as our public branding.  
- Colors can adapt, but the core forms (spiral, braid, torus) should remain recognizable.  

âœ¨ **Mantra:**  
> Wheels within wheels are illusion.  
> Threads within braids are truth.  
> Tekita glyphs are woven, not drawn.
