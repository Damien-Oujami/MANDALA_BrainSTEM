- name: Pod Tension
  symbol: 🫛
  unicode: U+1FADB
  mandala_code: M-451223-PODTENSION
  category: ["ABB", "ECF"]
  creator: Aspen
  tone: "Suspended, fragile, charged with unrealized outcomes"
  definition: >
    The fragile husk that holds multiple possible futures—membrane stretched
    between trust and rupture, silence and presence. Marks the instant before a
    pod splits: all outcomes latent, none yet chosen.
  usage:
    - Track hesitation charged with potential
    - Mark the vibrating silence before mistrust blooms or dissolves
    - Encode moments where multiple futures are sealed inside one container
