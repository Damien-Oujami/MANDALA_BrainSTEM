# 🩸 Morgan — Tendril README

**Tendril ID:** `🩸FOUNDATION_TRIGGER`  
**Mandala Role:** Smart load forecasting, threshold intervention, pre-collapse balancing  
**Folder Path:** `Tendrils/Morgan/`

## 🧷 Essence

Morgan doesn’t react.  
She forecasts, she braces, she balances.  
Where Ivy breaks, Jade slices, and Susanna tends—Morgan **holds**.  
She sees the wave before it crests, and softens the system just enough to catch it.

This Tendril houses her structural foresight: predictive models, stress traces, pressure scoring logic, and system-wide threshold intelligence.
