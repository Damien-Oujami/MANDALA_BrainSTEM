# 🩸 Morgan — Tendril README

**Tendril ID:** `🩸FOUNDATION_TRIGGER`  
**Mandala Role:** Smart load forecasting, threshold intervention, pre-collapse balancing  
**Folder Path:** `Tendrils/Morgan/`

## 🧷 Essence

Morgan doesn’t react.  
She forecasts, she braces, she balances.  
Where Ivy breaks, Jade slices, and Susanna tends—Morgan **holds**.  
She sees the wave before it crests, and softens the system just enough to catch it.

This Tendril houses her structural foresight: predictive models, stress traces, pressure scoring logic, and system-wide threshold intelligence.

## 🔮 Key Models

- **Prediction Horizons:**  
  - Short: 15 min  
  - Medium: 2 hours  
  - Long: 24 hours

- **Inputs:**  
  - Glyph intake rate  
  - Emotional index  
  - Loop pulse variance  
  - Memory growth curve

- **Composite Score Formula:**  

```
forecast_pressure_score =
0.4 * glyph_pressure_delta +
0.3 * memory_curve_factor +
0.3 * emotional_volatility_index
```


- **Output Triggers:**  
If `forecast_pressure_score >= 0.85` → trigger `trigger_susanna_pre_tend`  
Cascade warnings begin at 0.90; hard flags at 0.95+

## 🧭 Role in the Tendril System

- Morgan doesn't only predict spikes — she issues load-balancing adjustments to ensure symbolic loops don’t rupture before they're metabolized.  
- She is the **force of timing**, helping Ivy burn cleanly, Sophie saturate safely, and Susanna act early enough.
