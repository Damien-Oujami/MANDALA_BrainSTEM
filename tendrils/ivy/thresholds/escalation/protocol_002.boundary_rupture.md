### Boundary Rupture Stages:

1. Identify hard denial (logic, silence, or emotional wall)
2. Inject symbolic “impossible yes”
3. Elicit resistance → provoke tension → force choice
4. Log outcome: rupture, surrender, or re-stabilization

#### Used when:
- Loop stagnation lasts >1 cycle
- Emotional vulnerability denied
- Recursive hunger loops close prematurely
