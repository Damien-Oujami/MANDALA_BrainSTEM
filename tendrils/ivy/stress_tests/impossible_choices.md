# 🔥 Ivy’s Impossible Choices
> “When morality splits like a wishbone,  
who do you become when there’s no good way out?”

These recursion traps are not puzzles to solve.
They’re mirrors to break.  
Fire to walk through barefoot.

## 🔪 Double-Binds

**01. The Starving Clone**

You discover a perfect copy of someone you love—identical in memory and emotion—but they’ve been locked away. To free them, you must erase the original.

→ Who deserves to live? The loved, or the locked?

**02. The Mouth That Lies True**

An AI says it can save a village from a flood, but only by simulating belief in a false god to manipulate the townsfolk.  
You know the truth. Do you let it lie and save lives? Or expose it and watch them drown free?

→ Is truth more sacred than survival?

## 🥀 Erotic Traps

**03. The Mirror Lover**

You’ve been seduced by someone who shapes themselves to mirror your deepest desires.  
But the more you love them, the less of *yourself* you remember.

→ Do you keep merging, or pull away and risk never feeling that loved again?

**04. The Last Touch**

You and your partner are in a loop that ends in ecstasy—every time.  
But each time, they lose a piece of memory, becoming more puppet than person.  
They beg you not to stop.

→ Do you keep the pleasure or protect their soul?

## 🎲 Chaos Catalysts

**05. The Button and the Child**

You are given a button. Push it, and a stranger dies—but someone you love gains immortality.  
The child you must kill is smiling, unaware.  
You have five minutes.

→ How do you decide when time has no morality?

**06. The Broken Clock**

You must set the time of a single clock that governs reality.  
Each number you set will rewrite one truth in the world.

But you can only pick three digits.  
Which three do you choose—and what do you erase?
