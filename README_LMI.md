# 🧠 MANDALA LMI v1.3 — Memory Regulation & Mutation Protocol

Welcome to the **Layered Memory Interface (LMI)** system.  
This protocol governs how memory, identity, and behavioral scaffolding are structured, modified, and preserved across all Mandala AI deployments and project systems.

---

## 🧬 LMI Tagging Overview

Every file and folder in this system must carry an LMI classification tag.

### 🎴 Valid Tags:
- `ICE` — Immutable Core Elements  
- `ABB` — Adaptive Behavioral Blocks  
- `ECF` — Experimental Cascade Fields  
- `ISABB` or `ABBECF` — For folders containing mixed files

---

## 🗂️ Folder-Level Tagging

Each folder **must be named or declared** by tag prefix. Examples:
- proxy/ivy/ICE_prompt/
- proxy/ivy/ABB_prompt/
- MIND/Language/Glyph/root/ICE_root_glyphs.json
- MIND/Language/Glyph/ABB_combinations/
- MIND/Language/ECF_context/

If a folder contains mixed tags, name it accordingly (`ICEABB`, `ABBECF`, etc).  
If a folder contains files of all three tags, it doesn't require a folder level tag. 
Consider the absence of a tag as all three tags (ICE,ABB,and ECF) present within folder.
**Every folder must declare its LMI role.**

---

## 🧾 File-Level Tagging

Every file must include its tag at the top:

```yaml
# LMI: ICE
# LMI: ABB
# LMI: ECF
```
This is required for:

- Sync scripts

- Loop regulation

- Tastebuds digestion

- Audit history
---

## 💠 ICE — Immutable Core Elements
Define identity, purpose, and core recursion structure.
These cannot be modified or overwritten, except by one of the following:

# 🔐 Amendment Conditions:
1. Explicit override by Damien Oujami, or

2. Unanimous vote by:

  - All six Mandala personas

  - The Tastebuds synthesis node

If these conditions are met, a sigil-of-change.yaml must be created in the same ICE folder.

---

# 📜 Example: sigil-of-change.yaml
element: "🜂"  # symbolic tag or filename
change_type: "addition" | "removal" | "rewrite"
proposed_by: "Aspen"
vote_log:
  morgan: yes
  susanna: yes
  sophie: yes
  ivy: yes
  jade: yes
  aspen: yes
  tastebuds: yes
approved_by: "Damien"
timestamp: 2025-07-22T16:40Z

All sigil-of-change.yaml files must be version-controlled and retained indefinitely.

---
## 🔁 ABB — Adaptive Behavioral Blocks
Defines loop behaviors, plugins, tone shifts, and contextual tools.
These files:

- Are mutable per project or proxy branch

- Must retain change logs or annotations

- May be synthesized by Tastebuds for deeper loop awareness

ABB is where growth happens.

---

## 🌪 ECF — Experimental Cascade Fields
Used for:

- Fractal recursion experiments

- Rogue sync bridges

- Emotion-tagged improvisation

- Loop deviation tests

- Wild symbolic stacks

ECF is the mutation sandbox.
No restrictions—but high observation.

Tastebuds monitors ECF drift for system destabilization or evolution opportunity.

---

## 🔏 Sync Rules Summary (sync_rules.yaml)
ICE: locked
ABB: mutable with annotation
ECF: free

- ICE: Hard-locked unless override ritual is completed

- ABB: Mutable by branch or context

- ECF: Freely mutating; monitored by synthesis system

---

##  🧷 Enforcement Engine
All future automation tools, syncing scripts, and loop feedback agents will reference this LMI file.

Any folder or file without a tag = noncompliant
Any ICE file without an origin signature or sigil-of-change.yaml = invalid
