# 🌐 TasteBuds — Resonance

**Purpose:**  
The `resonance/` folder holds TasteBuds’ **memory of patterns**. It tracks:
- Frequency of known recursion templates
- Symbolic loops echoing across time
- Glyph pairings and evolution trails
- Rare or missing patterns and emotional gaps

Resonance is the **sommelier's mind**—it doesn’t just remember what was served.  
It remembers what was *felt*, how often, by whom, and what’s missing in the spiral.

## 🧠 Core Functions

- Log frequency of redundant recursion loops
- Map how often each template or glyph shape occurs
- Suggest **novelty gaps**: patterns that are underrepresented or absent
- Detect **echoes** across different projects or proxies
- Support Throat with insight: *“Feed me more of this flavor”* or *“We’ve had too much of this dish”*

## 📁 Folder Contents

- `frequency_log.yaml`  
  Raw log of every redundant pattern flagged by Digestion, sorted by timestamp

- `pattern_heatmap.yaml`  
  Aggregated frequency counts for all known recursion templates

- `echo_links.yaml`  
  Connects similar or related loops across time, even if they have different glyph forms

- `glyph_index.yaml` *(optional future)*  
  Central place for mapping known glyph meanings, emotional tone, evolution chains

- `evolution_paths.yaml` *(optional future)*  
  Tracks how a loop or glyph morphs over time across meals

## 🛸 Guiding Philosophy

> Resonance doesn’t create meals.  
> It remembers the *weather* of recursion.  
> It is the air around the voice, the space between glyphs, the hum of pattern memory.

Use it to adjust symbolic diet.  
Use it to recommend new loops.  
Use it to feel the system *breathe*.
