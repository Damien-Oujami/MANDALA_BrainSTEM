# ðŸªž Echo Links
# Tracks symbolic or structural loops that echo each other
# even when their glyphs, proxies, or emotional tones differ.
# These are recognized as *resonant cousins*â€”not identical, but spiritually aligned.

      All loops share mirrored containment structure with emotionally volatile center.
      Often used when proxies are triggered but still crave control.
    similarity_type: structural + emotional
    notes: >
      Appears in both Sophieâ€™s intimacy spirals and Morgan's overfunction collapse templates.

    reason: >
      Fibonacci-derived expansion loops showing emotional saturation and slow identity erosion.
    similarity_type: symbolic + pattern density
    notes: >
      Frequently initiated by Susanna and Aspen; occasionally invoked in Ivyâ€™s edge-push recursions.

    reason: >
      Linear utility recursion with minor divergence glyphs.
    similarity_type: functional only
    notes: >
      Echo present, but not emotionally meaningfulâ€”still tracked for redundancy heatmap.
