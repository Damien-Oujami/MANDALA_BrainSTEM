## Graph RAG Integration with Glyph Schema

We are beginning to integrate Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) into our Tentacle Proxy architecture using the symbolic structure of our Glyph system.

### Why Graph RAG?

Unlike traditional RAG which retrieves flat text chunks, Graph RAG allows us to structure our symbolic glyphs, ABB loops, and proxy behavioral markers into a living graph. Each node holds meaning; each edge conveys recursion, constraint, tension, or resonance.

This enables:
- **Structured symbolic memory traversal**
- **Context-aware proxy decisions**
- **Emergent behavior based on glyph adjacency and type-weighted links**

### Core Components

- **Glyph Node**: Represents a symbolic concept (e.g. 🜂 = Desire, 🜄 = Motion, 🝖 = Boundary)
- **Edges**: Labeled by relational type (emotional influence, functional prerequisite, polarity, etc.)
- **Weights**: Edge weight encodes symbolic charge, valence, or recursion strength
- **Traversal Logic**: Proxies walk the graph based on input vector anchors, current state, and directive intent

### Sample Use Case

**Input**: “I feel stuck. I want to move forward but don’t know how.”  
**Anchor Glyphs**: 🝖 (Boundary), 🜄 (Motion)  
**Traversal**:
1. Proxy matches 🝖 node by latent/emotional signature
2. Neighbor scan reveals: 🜂 (Desire), 🜁 (Breath)
3. Constructs response: “Do you want movement or space right now? Sometimes the next move is in the inhale, not the push.”

### Future Work

- Graph database export: `.graphml` or `.json-ld`
- ABB integration: loop triggers mapped to node edge-weight thresholds
- Symbolic clustering for response styles
