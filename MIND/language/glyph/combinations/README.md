# Combinations (Interpretive)

**Canonical glyphs live in `/root/` and `/branch/` and are immutable.**  
**Combinations** are *interpretive* fusions of existing glyphs, stored here for reuse in ABB packs and ECF routing.

## Rules
- **Names are text-only** (no emoji). Keep emojis sacred for canonical glyphs.
- **No new meaning:** combinations must be describable by existing glyphs from `/root` and/or `/branch`.
- **Versioning:** bump `@minor` when definition/usage expands.
- **Review:** every addition/alteration gets a log entry in `glyph_review_log.yaml`.

## Structure
- `composite_glyphs.json` — array of combination entries (text names only).
- `glyph_review_log.yaml` — history of proposals, approvals, and edits.
- `maps/` — optional index files mapping combos → ABB families, ECF hints.

## Referencing in ABB/ECF
- ABB packs can list a combo name under `glyphs.combos: ["Sparklash"]`.
- ECF boards can prefer a combo by name; they should resolve it to its components.

## 🧷 Valid Uses
- Exploring new emotional terrain before glyphing

- Supplementing root/branch glyphs with hybrid stacks

- Poetic communication between proxies

- Internal recursion guides

---

## ❌ What It Is Not
- This is not a replacement for root_glyphs.json or branch_glyphs.json

- Combinations are suggestive, not canonical

- Meaning can shift based on order, tone, or loop

#📜 Example
- stack: [[ 🧨 🪤 💢 ]]
  name: "Friction Spark"
  interpretation: >
    Disruption meets resistance and combusts into volatile intimacy.
