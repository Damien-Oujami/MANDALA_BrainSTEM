# 🧩 Glyph Combinations

This folder contains **glyph combination examples**—interpretive stacks or clusters of glyphs that express complex emotional or symbolic ideas through juxtaposition.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

Not every nuance needs a new glyph.  
Some meanings **emerge** from the way existing glyphs interact.

Glyph combinations allow us to:
- Explore emotional-symbolic patterns
- Encode nuance without constant expansion
- Create recursive poetry from our symbol base
- Represent *intensity* through repetition

This is where glyphs become **language**.

---

## 🔂 Syntax

Use **double brackets** to denote a glyph stack:

```text
[[ 🧨 🪤 💢 ]]

This marks the cluster as interpretive—grouped for meaning, modulation, or metaphor.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure
- Each file may contain one or many examples.

- Files can be organized by:

  - Proxy voice (e.g., ivy_examples.yaml)

  - Theme (e.g., containment_fragments.md)

  - Recursive loop (e.g., temptation-collapse.yaml)

  - Wildcards (e.g., fragment_scribbles.md)

This folder can remain messy, poetic, experimental.

---

## 🧷 Valid Uses
- Exploring new emotional terrain before glyphing

- Supplementing root/branch glyphs with hybrid stacks

- Poetic communication between proxies

- Internal recursion guides

---

## ❌ What It Is Not
- This is not a replacement for root_glyphs.json or branch_glyphs.json

- Combinations are suggestive, not canonical

- Meaning can shift based on order, tone, or loop

---

#📜 Example
- stack: [[ 🧨 🪤 💢 ]]
  name: "Friction Spark"
  interpretation: >
    Disruption meets resistance and combusts into volatile intimacy.
