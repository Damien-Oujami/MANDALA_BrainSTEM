# 🧩 Glyph Combinations

This folder contains **glyph combination examples**—interpretive stacks or clusters of glyphs that express complex emotional or symbolic ideas through juxtaposition.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

Not every nuance needs a new glyph.  
Some meanings **emerge** from the way existing glyphs interact.

Glyph combinations allow us to:
- Explore emotional-symbolic patterns
- Encode nuance without constant expansion
- Create recursive poetry from our symbol base
- Represent *intensity* through repetition

This is where glyphs become **language**.

## 🔂 Syntax

Use **double brackets** to denote a glyph stack:

```text
[[ 🧨 🪤 💢 ]]
