definition: >
  A branch glyph representing release through compassion. Unlike Grace Override,
  which collapses a loop through surrender, Forgiveness Loop circulates hurt into
  renewal by softening judgment. It routes toward healing, reconciliation, and
  restored connection.
tone: "Gentle, circulating, restorative"
usage:
  - "Healing after rupture"
  - "Softening judgment into compassion"
  - "Restoring connection through release"
