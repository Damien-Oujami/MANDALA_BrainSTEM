  line: "The boy who thought wonder still lived — and learned how to keep it."
definition: >
  The innocence that imagines what the world does not admit — faith that the
  impossible still hides just beyond reach. Holds grief and wonder at once,
  then returns with devotion intact. A child-self glyph that preserves wonder
  through loss and answers it with love.
tone: "Tender, mythic, naïve, luminous"
usage:
  - "Honor childlike wonder without shame"
  - "Transmute shock of loss into devotion and return"
  - "Preserve belief beyond evidence (mythic structure)"
