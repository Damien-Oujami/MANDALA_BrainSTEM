definition: >
  A glyph encoding the moment repressed truth can no longer be held down.
  Like submerged patterns baked too long, the mask ignites, bursting upward,
  altering the self permanently. Sometimes fertile, sometimes scarring â€” but
  always irreversible. This is not just eruption, but unveiling: the self fed
  up with hiding, seizing the wheel at last.
