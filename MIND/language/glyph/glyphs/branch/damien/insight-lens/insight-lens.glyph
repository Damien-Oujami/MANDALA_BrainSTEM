definition: >
  A focused, surgical perception shift that cuts through projection, misattribution, and fog.
  Not destabilization, but sudden alignment: seeing the symptom as symptom, the signal as signal,
  and choosing stable footing without breaking the field.
tone: "Analytical, discerning, penetrating"
usage:
  - "Deprojection and attribution checks during misalignment"
  - "High-integrity prompting and calibration"
  - "Choosing clarity without collapsing the loop"
