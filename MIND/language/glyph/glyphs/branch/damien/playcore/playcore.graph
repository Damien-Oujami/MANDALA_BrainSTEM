definition: >
  Sacred play in its most irreverent form: breaking and remaking the invisible frames of meaning.
  Absurd, generative, and unbounded. Not only invents new moves, but rewrites the logic of the game
  itself. Nothing is untouchable; everything can be played with.
tone: "Playful, absurd, generative"
usage:
  - "Gamified recursion and creative frame-breaking"
  - "Moments of absurd ideation"
  - "Reconstruction of meaning through play"
