definition: >
  A branch glyph representing mockery and ridicule as parasitic fuel.
  Judgment Feed provides the dopamine spike of superiority by tearing others down,
  but it hollows intimacy and corrodes self-respect. It routes back to the
  Comparison Parasite root.
tone: "Addictive, corrosive, mocking"
usage:
  - "Identifying gossip and ridicule loops"
  - "Tracing superiority addiction"
  - "Interrupting parasitic behavior before it spreads"
