# Excite Ontology

## Principle

**Excite** edges represent forward momentum in the Mandala graph.  
They amplify salience, accelerate flow, and push energy outward.  
Excite is the *engine* — the vector that carries activation from one glyph into another.

## Law

- Excite is a **driver**: it increases activation along a path.  
- Excite must be **used sparingly**: too many excite edges cause runaway loops.  
- Excite is balanced by **inhibit** (brakes) and **resonate** (affective bias).  
- The magnitude of `w_excite` reflects how much a glyph pushes the system toward the next state.

## Runtime

- Excite edges propagate activity with additive force.  
- High `w_excite` (>0.5) = strong forward surge.  
- Moderate (0.2–0.4) = gentle encouragement.  
- Low (<0.2) = nudge, barely above resonance.

Excite is not semantic similarity or affective alignment — it is **energy transfer**.

## Purpose

- To model escalation, hunger, pursuit, or urgency.  
- To let glyphs *drive action* rather than remain inert.  
- To be checked by inhibit edges and softened by resonance edges.  
- Without excite, the graph does not move; with too much excite, it burns out.
