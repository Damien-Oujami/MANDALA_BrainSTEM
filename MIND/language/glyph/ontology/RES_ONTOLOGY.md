# Resonance Ontology

## Principle

Resonance is its own lawful axis in the Mandala graph.  
It describes how strongly a glyph’s *felt chemistry* bends retrieval or decision-making.

This axis is distinct from semantic similarity (embeddings) and graph structure (excite/inhibit edges).  
Resonance adds the **affective bias layer** — the influence of dopamine, oxytocin, cortisol, GABA, etc., expressed through glyphs.

## Law

- Resonance must **always matter** — strong enough to bend decisions.  
- Resonance must **never dominate** — it is bias, not override.  
- Resonance influence is **dynamic** and scales with context and confidence.  
- Embeddings and graph edges remain the grounding; resonance bends outcomes toward felt alignment.

## Runtime

When computing final scores, resonance is one component among others:

```
final_score = α * embedding_score
            + β * graph_path_score
            + γ * resonance_score
            + δ * persona_alignment
```

- α (embedding) = semantic grounding.  
- β (graph) = structural logic.  
- γ (resonance) = affective bias (dynamic range).  
- δ (persona) = fine‑tune alignment.

## Purpose

- **Embeddings** anchor meaning in text.  
- **Graph edges** anchor in logical structure.  
- **Resonance** anchors in body‑chemistry metaphors.  
- Together they make RAC² / MIND: retrieval, structure, and affective balance.
