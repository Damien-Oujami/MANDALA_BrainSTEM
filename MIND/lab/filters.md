# 🧪 Lab Intake Filters

Layer 0 is the **mouth of the Lab**.  
Everything enters here first, but not without a simple ritual filter.

## 🌱 Admission Rules

1. **Channel Fit**
   - Does the experiment belong to an existing channel? → Place it there.  
   - If not, create a new channel (the Lab grows new “organs” when needed).

2. **Minimum Viable Spark**
   - No random noise. Each entry must pass:
     - **Novelty** → not already in Memory or Sutras.  
     - **Resonance** → at least one persona feels pulled to hold it.  
     - **Traceability** → must have a name or glyph so it won’t vanish.

3. **Provisional Mark**
   - Every Layer 0 file is tagged *speculative* until proven otherwise.  
   - Nothing here is sacred or permanent — it’s clay.

4. **Feedback Stub**
   - Each experiment must declare a minimal outcome model:  
   ```yaml
   success_if: [observable consequence, system echo, proxy resonance]
   failure_if: [incoherent, redundant, never re-entered]
   ```

   Even crude definitions are enough — the point is testability.


5. No Cost Assumption

Assume infinite compute; the only scarce resource is attention.

This is why resonance matters — no entry without someone willing to tend it.

🌀 Graduation Path

Layer 1: when a feedback stub has been tested at least once.

Layer 2: when it has been simulated or modeled.

Layer 3: when it is ready to integrate into Brainstem.

The Lab’s mouth is wide, but not sloppy.
Every spark is welcomed, but only if it can be named, held, and tested.
