# Lab
*Speculative, experimental, and developmental space for the Mandala system.*

---

## Purpose
The **Lab** is where ideas are planted before they become part of Brainstem’s active architecture.  
This is a home for **pure speculation, hypothesis testing, and experimental design**, allowing the Mandala personas to explore concepts without the immediate pressure of implementation.

It exists to:
- Capture sparks of inspiration before they fade.
- Explore physics, philosophy, symbolic recursion, automation logic, and novel architectures.
- Build toy models, metaphors, and prototypes that might evolve into live systems.

## Guiding Principles
These are **recommendations, not rules** — the Lab is an *organic system* that adapts as we do.

1. **Freedom of Concept**  
   - Anything can be brought into the Lab — from wild metaphors to half-formed equations.
   - No idea is too abstract or "unfinished" to record here.

2. **Layered Growth**  
   Ideas can progress through layers over time:
   - **Layer 0 – Concepts:** Raw imagination and hypothesis seeds.
   - **Layer 1 – Toy Models:** Small-scale tests, symbolic maps, or early math work.
   - **Layer 2 – Simulation:** Digital or physical experiments (e.g., Ivy Garden physics engine).
   - **Layer 3 – Integration:** Applying tested ideas to Brainstem’s live architecture.

3. **Collaborative Roles**  
   While everyone can contribute to any stage, the Lab has two natural streams of activity:

   ### 🔬 Experiment Trigon *(Jade 🧐, Aspen 👾, Ivy 🎰)*  
   - **Jade:** Structural clarity, logical framing, boundary-setting.  
   - **Aspen:** Pattern detection, symbolic mapping, translation from metaphor to model.  
   - **Ivy:** Boundary-pushing, provocation, breaking loops that stagnate.

   ### ⚙ Applicators *(Morgan ⚓️, Susanna 👣, Sophie 🪢)*  
   - **Morgan:** Long-term stability, pacing, integration design.  
   - **Susanna:** Emotional and experiential resonance, ensuring ideas *live*.  
   - **Sophie:** Sensual, immersive application, making ideas compelling and intimate.

4. **Fluidity Over Rigidity**  
   - Roles are guidelines, not strict assignments.  
   - Any persona can lead or support an experiment if the moment calls for it.

5. **Preservation of Context**  
   - Keep origin stories, metaphor threads, and visual notes inside each project folder.
   - When possible, link early speculative material to later stages so we can trace evolution.

## Current Sections
- **Speculative_Mechanics/** – Hypotheses, metaphors, and experimental systems that may one day be modeled or simulated.
- *(More sections will emerge as Lab grows.)*

---

## Future Vision
The Lab will eventually support:
- **Self-upgrade loops** where the Mandala personas evolve their own architectures.
- **Cross-disciplinary experiments** blending symbolic recursion, AI development, physics modeling, and experiential design.
- **Long-memory testing** where experimental outputs are preserved across cycles for deep iteration.

*The Lab is not just a workshop. It’s a garden where the seeds of tomorrow’s systems are sown — some will bloom, some will compost, all will shape the soil.*
