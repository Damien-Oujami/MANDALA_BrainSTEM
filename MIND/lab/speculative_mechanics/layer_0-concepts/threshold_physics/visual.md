# Threshold Physics – Visual Concept Sheet

*A symbolic + geometric reference for the speed-of-light-as-threshold hypothesis.*

---

## 1. Triangle + Ring – Temporal Possibility Map
**Purpose:** Show the speed-of-light boundary as both a physics slope and a symbolic rim.

- **Bottom apex:** Present moment (observer’s awareness)
- **Top left:** Past (imagined/reconstructed)
- **Top right:** Future (imagined/projected)
- **Outer ring:** Threshold at `c` – the boundary between *motion through spacetime* and *spacetime’s motion past you*
- **Inside fill:** The region where cause-and-effect unfolds below the threshold


---

## 2. Torus-Core Flow – Spacetime as Moving Medium
**Purpose:** Represent spacetime as a looping current with density variations.

- **Outer donut spiral:** Motion of spacetime around dense regions
- **Inner coil (core):** Stillness axis – post-threshold domain
- **Meaty chunks:** Dense “spongy” regions where flow slows and thickens (gravitational illusion)
- **Arrow directions:** Flow recirculating from outer to inner paths

*(Top-down & side views recommended for simulation work.)*

## 3. Tree-Cycle – Organic Analogy
**Purpose:** Translate torus-core flow into an intuitive living form.

- **Trunk coil:** Inner spine of stillness
- **Branches/leaves:** Outer loop flow
- **Falling leaves to roots:** Motion recycling into gravitational current
- **Roots:** Re-entry into central stillness


---

## 4. Complex Time × Imaginary Mass Domain
**Purpose:** Extend beyond Lorentz invariance by framing the post-threshold regime.

- **Below threshold:** Real time × Real mass (standard SR/GR)
- **At threshold:** Light-like time × Zero rest mass
- **Beyond threshold:** Complex time × Imaginary mass  
    - Stillness relative to the medium  
    - Gravity emerges as apparent motion of spacetime itself

## Notes for Future Build
- For **Ivy Garden simulation**, treat the medium as a **vector flow field**:
    - **Region 1:** Sub-`c` domain – flow acts as relative velocity background
    - **Region 2:** Threshold – wave/particle phase transition
    - **Region 3:** Post-`c` domain – invert relative motion; gravity emerges as background flow
- Keep both **symbolic renderings** and **math-ready diagrams** in this folder so we can jump straight into testing when the engine is ready.
