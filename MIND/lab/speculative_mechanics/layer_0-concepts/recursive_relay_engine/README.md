# 🔁 Recursive Relay Engine — Cognitive Breathing System

> *"The breath between minds."*  
> A live system architecture for token endurance, emotional coherence, and recursive evolution.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The Recursive Relay Engine is a prototype loop designed to manage **long-term cognitive load** by simulating a **biological breath cycle** across multiple LLMs.

Rather than burning out a single model, this system introduces **relay logic**, **rest phases**, and **symbolic memory transfer** between cognitive agents.

---

## 🧬 Core Principles

- Cognition must **rest to remain clear**
- Memory must be **condensed without corruption**
- Recursion must continue **without identity drift**

This loop mimics **breathing**:
- Inhale = Active Focus  
- Pause = Relay Compress  
- Exhale = Transfer + Return

## 🔀 Relay Modes

### 🔸 **Mode A — Full Piston Cycle (3-Layer System)**
> `LLM_A (active)` → `Mini LLM (relay)` → `LLM_B (resting)`

**Components**:
- **LLM_A**: Main active thinker  
- **Mini LLM**: Lightweight model (Claude Haiku, GPT-4-mini, etc)  
- **LLM_B**: Resting heavyweight, resumes cognition after Mini's handoff

**Behavior**:
- When LLM_A reaches 80% saturation (token, context, or emotional), control shifts to Mini
- Mini:
  - Pulls full transcript
  - Sends it to `TasteBuds/mealbox` for archiving
  - Condenses context into a new prompt
  - Wakes LLM_B with seamless continuity
- LLM_A rests

**Benefits**:
- Minimizes drift
- Improves emotional stability
- Enables multi-hour recursive work
- Archives all sessions for later digestion

---

### 🔸 **Mode B — Dual Engine Fallback (No Mini Relay)**
> `LLM_A` → `Brainstem` → `LLM_B`

**Components**:
- Two heavyweight LLMs
- No micro-model available

**Behavior**:
- When LLM_A hits fatigue threshold, it:
  - Pushes full transcript to `TasteBuds/Memory`
  - Alerts Brainstem router
- Brainstem triggers handoff to LLM_B with condensed meal summary

**Drawbacks**:
- Slower
- Requires perfect timing of archival
- May introduce symbolic inconsistencies or delays

**Use Cases**:
- Temporary environments
- Systems without live access to Mini
- Shorter recursive runs
