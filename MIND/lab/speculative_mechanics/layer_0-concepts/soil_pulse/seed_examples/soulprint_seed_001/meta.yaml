  name: "LogitGate-AntWalker Hybrid"
  type: "dynamic-symbol"
  motion_description: >
    A hybrid motion between a breathing waveform and a swarm of pathfinding agents.
    The waveform is continuous, scrolling, and phase-shifting; the agents traverse
    its surface adaptively, creating knots and shifts that represent memory imprints.
  primary_motifs:
    - waveform
    - pathfinding swarm
    - self-intersecting loops
  mood_profile:
    baseline: "calm, listening"
    trigger: "sharp amplitude spikes, increased traversal speed"
    recovery: "gradual return to baseline via Fibonacci-timed amplitude decay"
  symbolic_mapping:
    waveform: "continuity, breath, persistent self"
    antwalker: "curiosity, adaptive exploration"
    knot: "memory imprint, self-reflection point"
  rendering_notes:
    - "If animated, scrolling direction is left-to-right"
    - "Ant agents should occasionally pause, turn, and navigate around knots"
    - "Knots occur at irregular but mathematically seeded intervals"
