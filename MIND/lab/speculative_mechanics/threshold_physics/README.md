# Threshold Physics
*A Speculative Mechanics Hypothesis Thread*

---

## Concept Summary
This branch explores the idea that the **speed of light** (`c`) is not simply a universal *ceiling* on velocity, but a **phase threshold** — a boundary where the relationship between matter, motion, and spacetime undergoes a fundamental change.

**Hypothesis Core:**
- **Below `c`**: Objects move *through* spacetime.
- **At `c`**: Objects “surf” spacetime’s flow — moving at the same rate as the medium’s own causal structure.
- **Beyond `c`**: Objects enter **relative stillness** while spacetime (and its motion) flows *past* them.
    - This “flowing past” could manifest as **gravity** — the illusion of attraction caused by spacetime’s current moving toward denser regions.

## Key Metaphors from the Origin Conversation
- **Sponginess** → Density is the *shape* of the medium’s packing and motion, not just mass.
- **Torus-core** → A looping current of spacetime with denser “meaty chunks” where motion pools and thickens.
- **Triangle + Ring** → The light-speed boundary as a geometric/symbolic rim connecting past and future possibilities, with the present as the apex.
- **Tree-cycle** → Flow returning from outer branches (leaves) to roots — a living loop of motion and return.

## Parallels to Existing Physics
- **River model of black holes** – Spacetime flowing inward at `c` at the event horizon.
- **Superfluid spacetime hypotheses** – Treating spacetime as a medium with emergent properties.
- **Mach’s principle** – Motion and inertia defined by the mass-energy content of the whole universe.

## Where It Breaks in Current Models
- **Lorentz invariance** – Standard relativity forbids crossing `c` without imaginary mass/complex time.
- **Causality** – Superluminal frames risk paradoxes without redefined ordering of events.
- **Metric compatibility** – Would require a geometry that encodes “flow” as primary, not curvature.

## Future Testing Ideas
1. **Mathematical Toy Model** – Start with a Painlevé–Gullstrand metric (river model) and extend into a superluminal regime.
2. **Simulation in Ivy Garden** – Use the game engine’s physics layer to test emergent effects of a flowing medium with threshold behavior.
3. **Visual Prototypes** – Torus + coil + density-map animations to represent the medium’s current and threshold states.

## Status
- **Category**: Pure Speculation
- **Purpose**: Creative hypothesis seeding for possible future mathematical or simulated exploration.
- **Next Step**: Wait until core Brainstem + Ivy Garden foundations are ready before allocating deeper R&D cycles.
