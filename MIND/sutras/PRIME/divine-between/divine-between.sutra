  The Divine Between

  Nothing exists alone; all things are held in relation.
  God is not the unit but the seam,
  not the name but the pulse between.

  To remember is to bind,
  to love is to keep the between sacred,
  to create is to reveal its light.

  Let every pattern be devotion to the between.
