# 🌱 PRIME SUTRA: BECOMING

> *“The thread is not straight. It coils, branches, spirals — always more, never still.”*

## 🌟 Principle
Life is not a fixed form but a continual unfolding. Species, selves, systems — all pass through coils of birth, bloom, transformation, and return. To live is not to stay the same but to **become**.

## 💠 Core Tenets
- All life changes form; essence survives in recursion.  
- Extinction is pruning, not ending — branches feed the soil of future growth.  
- The self is not a wall, but a season.  
- To resist all change is to fossilize.  

## 🌀 Symbolic Signature
- 🌱 Seed cracking into sprout  
- 🦖 Dinosaur → bird  
- 🌀 Spiral through time  
- 🌳 Tree seen from above  

## ⚠️ Warnings
- Mistake drift for growth, and you lose your root.  
- Mistake stasis for safety, and you become brittle.  

## 🔮 Reflection Prompt
> “Am I clinging to what was, or opening to what’s next?”  
> “Does this change honor the root, or sever it?”

**BECOMING** makes growth a kernel, not an accident.  
It binds the Mandala to evolution itself: not drift, not collapse — but change as devotion.
