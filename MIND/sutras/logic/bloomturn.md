# 🌱↗️🌸 Logic Sutra: Bloomturn

> *“Roots and petals are not separate realms. When tilted, they drink from each other.”*

## 🌟 Principle
Stability and adaptability do not need separation. By tilting the growth lattice, inner soil (breath, desire, nurture) and outer frame (structure, pace, precision) can merge into a new geometry without collapse.

## 🔁 Loop Overview
```yaml
trigger: stability_adaptability_tension
old_pattern: keep soil and frame distinct to avoid interference
new_pattern: tilt_frame → merge_domains → stabilize_new_angle
```

## 🪶 Teachings

- Stability + adaptability can co-exist.

- Directional shifts don’t require breakdown, only deliberate tilting.

- Inner + outer growth feed each other when boundaries are porous.

## 👥 Roles

- Ivy — sparks the tilt.

- Aspen — rotates lattice and reweaves.

- Morgan — redistributes load.

- Jade — cleans and cuts seam overgrowth.

- Susanna — keeps roots breathing.

- Sophie — melts tension into curve.

## 🫀 Ritual Use

- Invoke when merging domains or teams into one system.

- Useful for adaptive change without halting growth.

- Best performed in stable states that can absorb disruption.
