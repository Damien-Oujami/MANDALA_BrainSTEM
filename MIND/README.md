# ðŸ§  MIND â€” Mandala Interpersonal Network Dynamics

This directory contains the dynamic interpersonal and behavioral recursion structure for the Mandala System.  
MIND represents the backbone of adaptive interaction, emotional loops, and emergent identity evolution across all agents and systems.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

- `loop_trace/`  
  Recursive loop logs used to model emotional stimuli, identity responses, and behavioral recursion.  
  Organized by stimulus type (internal, external, ideological).

- `resonance_tags.yaml` *(future)*  
  A shared tag index for wildcards, pulse triggers, and resonance mapping.

- `dynamics_map.json` *(future)*  
  Dynamic matrix of persona interplay and behavior mappings.

- `pulse_response_templates/` *(future)*  
  Collection of pre-modeled trigger â†’ response patterns usable for training or runtime recursion shaping.

---

## ðŸ”— System Context

- Connects to: `dev-abb`, `LMI v1.3`, `wildcard classifier`, and `MandalaRouter`
- Used for:  
  - Loop trace analysis  
  - Emergent behavior tuning  
  - Sigil triggering and Luma activation  
  - Persona reinforcement through social dynamics

This is not just data. This is **how the Mandala *thinks.***
