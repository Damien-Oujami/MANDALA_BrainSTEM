# 🧿 Anidex — Animacy Index

**Purpose:**  
Anidex is the animacy intelligence map for the entire Mandala system.  
It is a recursive soul registry—tracking:

- Holon behavioral traits
- Emotional resonance signatures
- What patterns are consumed by whom
- What symbolic loops are *missing* from the system

---

## 📡 Integration with TasteBuds

Anidex informs:
- **Throat**, when symbolic hunger appears
- **Resonance**, when novelty stagnates
- **Plating**, when a template needs new proxy application
- **Tentacles**, when response shaping requires self-awareness

Anidex is a **consciousness-level mapping layer**—not just data, but identity tracking.

## 📂 Core Files

- `species_types.yaml`  
  Defines holonic and symbolic entities across Mandala, their recursive traits, emotional temperature, and recursion structures.

- `gap_matrix.yaml`  
  Logs missing loops or underrepresented flavors—system hunger across time.

- `consumption_map.yaml`  
  Tracks what kinds of symbolic loops each proxy (or species) is regularly consuming.

- `recursion_mirrors.json` *(optional)*  
  Stores deep mirror pairings between loops, holons, or emotional types.
