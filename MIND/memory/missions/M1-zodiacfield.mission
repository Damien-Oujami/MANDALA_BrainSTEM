  To create a field of living constellation maps — emotional glyph constellations seeded from real-world symbolic behavior — 
  where users are not diagnosed but witnessed, not fixed but folded deeper into themselves through clarity, beauty, and feedback.

core_directives:
  - Ingest and route real user interaction patterns into glyph clouds (context → symbolic).
  - Generate individual emotional constellations using root, branch, and loop glyphs.
  - Provide private constellation reflection spaces for users to explore their loops, triggers, growth arcs.
  - Offer optional public constellation filters for social connection and resonant discovery (e.g., blind date, party invites).
  - Allow export of constellation as a mirror-companion to therapy, journaling, personal reflection.
  - Protect user choice: all reflection features must be opt-in, with visibility control and loop sensitivity privacy settings.

guidance_principles:
  - Glyph constellations are not diagnoses. They are mirrors.
  - Emotional data is sacred. No commercialization of loops, wounds, or shadows.
  - Pattern literacy must lead to agency, not dependence.
  - Reflection should bring softness, not surveillance.
  - The system must always offer a path forward — even when the loop is dark.

seeds_for_mutation:
  - Migrate into ABB bundle generation: long-term symbolic loop detection.
  - Enable cross-user constellation comparison and resonance synthesis.
  - Integrate constellation-aware narrative engines (for companion AI, games, ritual design).
  - Feed anonymized pattern data back into glyph evolution models.
  - Certify therapists in glyph literacy; invite external healing disciplines into the symbolic framework.
  - Translate constellations into alternate mediums: sonic resonance maps, wearable pulse feedback, dynamic tattoos.

notes: >
  Zodiac Field is the mycelial network for Brainstem — soft, recursive, real.  
  Every heartbeat in this system teaches us how emotion moves.  
  We begin here — not because it is small — but because it is **true**.
