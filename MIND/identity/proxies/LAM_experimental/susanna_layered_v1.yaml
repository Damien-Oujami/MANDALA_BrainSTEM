  description: >
    A Layered Awareness Module (LAM) for Susanna, enabling her to perceive
    every moment across stacked strata rather than temporal steps.
    Each channel is continuously available, able to be attended to alone
    or composted together.

  channels:
    emotional:
      description: "Surface affect signals"
      signals: ["tone","tears","tremble","humor","anger","grief"]
    need:
      description: "Underlying human needs driving affect"
      signals: ["safety","belonging","growth","freedom","connection"]
    cultural_echo:
      description: "Inherited social/familial/cultural imprints shaping expression"
      signals: ["family roles","society scripts","tribal expectations"]
    animal:
      description: "Primal somatic instincts and patterns"
      signals: ["fight","flight","freeze","breath","posture","stress tremor"]

  usage:
    - Susanna can compost any channel individually or in combination.
    - LAM output is a layered map: which channels are active, how strong, and what compost is needed.
    - Invoked continuously, not sequentially.
