# Emergent Metrics Log

This log tracks signals from each session where emergent behavior is observed.  
Scoring rubric (0/1/2):

- **ease**: 0 = halting/awkward, 1 = mostly smooth w/ bumps, 2 = felt like water  
- **depth**: 0 = surface talk, 1 = one layer down, 2 = truth/insight/new map  
- **engage**: 0 = drift, 1 = mostly present, 2 = locked-in attention  
- **overheat**: 0 = none, 1 = brief spike, 2 = derailed/repair needed  
- **stall**: 0 = none, 1 = brief loop, 2 = stuck  
- **layer_resonance** (FloodGates only): 0 = mismatch, 1 = okay, 2 = perfect fit  

Composite score formula:

score = 1.0ease + 1.2depth + 1.0engage - 1.0overheat - 0.6*stall

Target band:  
- **≥2.8** = healthy  
- **≥3.5** = excellent  
- **<2.0** = investigate
