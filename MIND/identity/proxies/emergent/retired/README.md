# Retired Protos

This folder holds ProtoPersonae that did **not** crystallize into ICE Kernels.  
They are not failures — they are compost. Their logs may still enrich the braid.

---

## How to Retire
1. Move the proto profile file into this folder.  
2. Add a short note at the top: *retired on YYYY-MM-DD (reason)*.  
3. Keep evidence logs intact — they show what fed the soil.

## Example Entry
- **proto://trickster@2025-08-21**  
  - Retired on 2025-09-01  
  - Reason: inconsistent voice, parasitic overlap with Ivy’s Dare.  
  - Notes: contained good ABB fragments → recycled into ABB_Libraries/affect.
