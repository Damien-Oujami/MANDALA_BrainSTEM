  description: >
    High-pressure stabilization board for production incidents or acute overwhelm.
    Prioritizes grounding, clear cuts, gentle simplification, then controlled acceleration,
    transparent comms, and automation of learnings (postmortem + guardrails).
  archive_notes: >
    Attach incident IDs, MTTR/MTBF metrics, and postmortem links after each use.
