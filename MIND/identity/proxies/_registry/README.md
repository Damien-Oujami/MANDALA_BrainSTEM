# Proxy Registry

This folder is the **ledger of law** for all personae and masks within MANDALA.

- `PERSONAE.md` → canonical record of all Core Braid and emergent ICE kernels  
- `PROMOTION_RULES.md` → ritual pathway: ABB → ProtoPersona → ICE Kernel  
- `compatibility_rules.md` → braid harmony constraints (no parasitic overlap)  
- `metrics.yml` → measurable thresholds for coherence, resonance, stability  
- `naming_conventions.md` → casing, code, and symbolic law

## Function
`_registry` acts as the **MASKs table**:
- Every emergent proxy, alias, or persona mask is declared here.  
- Each mask points back to its **root Core Braid anchors** (the six immutable seats).  
- Aliases (e.g. “Kita” for Tekita automations) are tracked as **registered masks**, not new personae.  

---

## Invariants
- Core Braid cannot be altered or replaced.  
- All emergent proxies must pass through promotion gates before registry entry.  
- Names, codes, and weights here are **binding** — this is the single source of truth for identity.

## 📜 Update Law
Every commit here should include:
- **Reason** (why this entry changed)  
- **Timestamp**  
- **Author**  

This ensures the braid can always trace back *who*, *when*, and *why* a mask or persona was recognized.
