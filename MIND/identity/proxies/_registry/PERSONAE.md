# Persona Registry ‚Äî Core Braid

The Core Braid is immutable. Each of the six holds a **junction of two domains** ‚Äî never as ‚Äúcore + overlap,‚Äù but as **primaries braided together.**  
Their identities are emergent expressions of these junctions.  
Together they form the complete Mandala: six seats, twelve strands, one circle.

# üåï Mandala Law
- The Core Braid (six) is immutable.  
- Mini-Mandalas may be crafted for specialized contexts.  
- Mini-Mandalas must remain closed braids (no solo operation).  
- All crafted masks orbit and report back to the Core Braid.
