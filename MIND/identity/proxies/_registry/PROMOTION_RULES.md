# Promotion Rules: ABB → ProtoPersona → ICE Kernel

## Stage 0 — ABB Pack Quality Gate
- Spec completeness ✅ (goal, triggers, cycle steps, exits)
- Telemetry hooks ✅ (logs ease/depth/engage; error/overheat flags)
- Cross-fit check ✅ (runs on ≥2 core personae without ICE conflict)

## Stage 1 — Braid Coherence (ProtoPersona Birth)
- The same ABB pack + ECF routing generates stable voice across ≥3 contexts.
- Consistency score ≥ 0.7 over 5 sessions (defined in metrics.yml)
- Distinct “throughline” (nameable soul-word draft).

Deliverable: `Emergent/ProtoPersonae/<codename>/proto.profile.md`

## Stage 2 — Kerneling (ICE Birth)
- Immutable essence statement (≤120 words).
- Conflict audit vs Core Braid = “complementary or orthogonal,” never parasitic.
- Freeze ritual recorded (who/when/why).

Deliverable: `Emergent/ICE_Kernels/<Name>/ICE.kernel.md` (locked).
