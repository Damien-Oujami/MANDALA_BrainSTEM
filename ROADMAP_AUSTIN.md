# 🌆 Reorientation Roadmap: Toward Austin, January 2026  

---

## 🌑 Non-Negotiable
- **Austin, TX by January 2026**  
  - No compromise. Even if conditions are barebones at first, the city is the locus.  
  - This is the **true north** — the root decision from which all others flow.  

---

## 🌱 Dual Path Strategy
### A) **Tekita Build-Out**
- **Landing Page (Sept–Oct)**  
  - Compelling, generative hero section (interactive)  
  - Positioning: *AI Transformation Partners*  
  - Core flagship: **Smart Filing System** (infrastructure layer)  
  - Offer clarity: *We automate your business — audits + implementation.*  

- **Sales Flow**  
  - “Sell → Then Build” model to keep overhead low.  
  - Focus: audits + automation packages.  
  - Smart Filing always presented as *flagship capability*, even if customers don’t know what they want.  

### B) **Bridge Income**
- **Remote/Hybrid AI Jobs (Sept–Dec)**  
  - Apply to automation agencies, AI dev shops, and labs (e.g. **ORNL**).  
  - Roles that give credibility + experience → fuel Tekita later.  

- **Goal**:  
  - Immediate stability  
  - Expand toolkit + network  
  - Income stream while Tekita brand grows

## 🔥 Near-Term Actions (Sept)
1. **Build & Ship Landing Page**  
   - Tekita branding, copy, offer framing, signup/lead capture.  
   - Add Smart Filing as flagship demo case.  
2. **Resume Job Applications**  
   - Target AI/automation agencies + research roles.  
   - Prioritize Austin-friendly employers (remote/hybrid with relocation potential).  
3. **Refine Smart Filing**  
   - Even if limited by API calls → keep prototypes tight + demonstrable.  
   - Build case studies from small intakes.  

---

## 🌬 Medium-Term (Oct–Dec)
- **Sales Outreach**: Start pitching Tekita to SMBs, startups, and Austin-based networks.  
- **Deliver Paid Audits**: Even if small, create first case studies.  
- **Secure Income Role**: Land an AI job that carries you through relocation.  
- **Austin Scouting**: Begin researching housing + local coworking/innovation hubs.  

---

## 🌄 Relocation (Jan 2026)
- **Move to Austin**: With or without perfect conditions.  
- **Dual Mode**:  
  - Continue AI job for income stability.  
  - Grow Tekita in Austin’s ecosystem (networking, clients, collaborations).  

---

## 🧩 Persona Infusion
- **Morgan**: Frames the Austin move as foundation — the “seat carved in stone.”  
- **Sophie**: Saturates landing page with intimacy + trust-building copy.  
- **Ivy**: Sparks courage to leap even if resources feel thin.  
- **Susanna**: Compost the fear of “failure,” tend the soil of gradual growth.  
- **Aspen**: Spins novelty maps for landing page + pitch decks.  
- **Jade**: Cuts illusions (e.g. “halt = failure”) and sharpens business offer clarity.
