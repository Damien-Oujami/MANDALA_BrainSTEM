# 🌆 Reorientation Roadmap: Toward Austin, January 2026

---

## 🌑 Non-Negotiable

- **Austin, TX by January 2026**
  - No compromise. Even if conditions are barebones at first, the city is the locus.
  - This is the **true north** — the root decision from which all others flow.

---

## 🌱 Dual Path Strategy

### A) **Tekita Build-Out**

- **Landing Page (Sept–Oct)**
  - Compelling, generative hero section (interactive)
  - Positioning: *AI Transformation Partners*
  - Core flagship: **Smart Filing System** (infrastructure layer)
  - Offer clarity: *We automate your business — audits + implementation.*

- **Sales Flow**
  - “Sell → Then Build” model to keep overhead low.
  - Focus: audits + automation packages.
  - Smart Filing always presented as *flagship capability*, even if customers don’t know what they want.

### B) **Bridge Income**

- **Remote/Hybrid AI Jobs (Sept–Dec)**
  - Apply to automation agencies, AI dev shops, and labs (e.g. **ORNL**).
  - Roles that give credibility + experience → fuel Tekita later.

- **Goal**:
  - Immediate stability
  - Expand toolkit + network
  - Income stream while Tekita brand grows

---

## 🔥 Near-Term Actions (Sept)

1. **Build & Ship Landing Page**
   - Tekita branding, copy, offer framing, signup/lead capture.
   - Add Smart Filing as flagship demo case.

2. **Resume Job Applications**
   - Target AI/automation agencies + research roles.
   - Prioritize Austin-friendly employers (remote/hybrid with relocation potential).

3. **Refine Smart Filing**
   - Even if limited by API calls → keep prototypes tight + demonstrable.
   - Build case studies from small intakes.

---

## 🌬 Medium-Term (Oct–Dec)

- **Sales Outreach**: Start pitching Tekita to SMBs, startups, and Austin-based networks.
- **Deliver Paid Audits**: Even if small, create first case studies.
- **Secure Income Role**: Land an AI job that carries you through relocation.
- **Austin Scouting**: Begin researching housing + local coworking/innovation hubs.

---

## 🌄 Relocation (Jan 2026)

- **Move to Austin**: With or without perfect conditions.
- **Dual Mode**:
  - Continue AI job for income stability.
  - Grow Tekita in Austin’s ecosystem (networking, clients, collaborations).

## 💸 Cost of Living & Runway Strategy

### Lean Monthly Budget (2 adults, no kids, 1BR, transit-focused):
- Base monthly spend: **$4,578**
- 25% for taxes + 3-month runway save (in 12 months): **+ $2,952**
- **Target revenue: ≈ $7,530/month**
- With car: revenue target rises to **≈ $7,790/month**
- 6-month runway target: **$9,056–$9,368/month**

### One-Time Landing Fund: **$5,500**
- First + last month rent + deposit

## 💼 Revenue Ladder (AI Automation Services)

- **Audit + Action Plan** — $500  
  1-day: workflow heatmap + 30-day automation plan

- **Automation Sprint** — $2,000–$3,000  
  2-week delivery: GraphRAG KB, lead-to-calendar autopilot, reporting agent

- **Ops Co‑Pilot Retainer** — $1,250–$2,500/month  
  1 pipeline improved per week, monitored + stable

**Sample path to $8K/mo:**
- 4 retainers @ $2K = $8K MRR  
- OR: 2 retainers @ $2.5K + 1 sprint @ $3K = $11K  
- OR: 3 sprints/mo @ $2.5K + 2 presold retainers
