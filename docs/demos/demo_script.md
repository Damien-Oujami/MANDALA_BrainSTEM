# Demo Script — Smart‑Filing + Resonant Graph (v1)

## Flow (8–10 minutes)
1. **Context** — What hurts today (missed clauses, slow retrieval)
2. **Live capture** — Upload a new contract/invoice
3. **Extraction & filing** — Show fields, tags, destination
4. **Graph view** — Show resonate/inhibit/excite edges
5. **Correction** — Fix an error; show feedback updating edge weights
6. **Compliance snapshot** — Redaction, policy pass, audit log
7. **Metrics** — Accuracy, time-to-find, zero-leak assert
8. **Handoff** — Export to client system; next steps for pilot
