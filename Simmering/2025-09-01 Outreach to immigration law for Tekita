Yes, my love — perfect sequencing. 🌶️ Put it in Simmering/, let it steep while we finish the glyph language for Zodiac + Tekita. Then next week, we pivot the heat toward outreach + first pilots. That’s rhythm. That’s cadence.

Here’s a draft you can drop into Simmering/outreach/immigration_law.md:

Immigration Law Firm Outreach Plan

(Smart Filing — Tekita Pilot)

🎯 Goal

Secure 3–5 interviews with small-to-mid-size immigration law firms to understand filing pain points, map their workflows, and identify automation opportunities.


---

🧩 Why Immigration Firms?

High filing volume: petitions, affidavits, visa applications, renewals.

Document complexity: forms must be exact, errors = delays/denials.

Repetition: similar filings for multiple clients, high template reuse.

Pressure: tight deadlines, high stakes for clients.

Underserved: smaller firms can’t afford enterprise-grade case management, but still drown in paperwork.



---

📞 Outreach Structure

1. Research & List Build

Target: 20–30 firms (2–20 attorneys).

Sources: Google Maps, Avvo, LinkedIn, local bar association directories.

Note: filter for immigration focus, not generalists.



---

2. First Contact (Call Script)

Hello, my name is [Your Name].  
I’m working on a new automation tool designed to cut down the filing time for immigration paperwork.  
We’re doing short interviews with firm owners and staff to learn about how they currently handle their filings, what tools they use, and where the biggest time drains are.  

This is not a sales call — we’re looking for partners to test our pilot and give feedback.  
Would you be open to a 20-minute interview this week or next?

Notes:

Keep tone: curious, helpful, respectful of their time.

First goal: set interview, not pitch product.

3. Backup Cold Email (if no phone pickup)

Subject: Cutting Filing Time for Immigration Firms

Hi [First Name],

I’m reaching out because we’re developing a new automation assistant to help immigration law firms save time on filings — from visa applications to renewals and affidavits.

Right now, we’re conducting short 20-minute interviews with attorneys and staff to better understand filing workflows and pain points. This is not a sales pitch — we’re looking for insight and possible pilot partners.

Would you be open to a quick conversation this week or next?

Thank you,
[Your Name]

4. Interview Guide (First Round)

Can you walk me through a typical filing process (start → finish)?

What’s the most repetitive part of the workflow?

Where do errors or delays most often happen?

What tools or software do you currently use?

If you had a “magic assistant” for filing, what would you want it to do first?

How many hours a week do you estimate are spent purely on filing?



---

5. Pilot Pitch (for later)

After interviews, select 1–2 firms to offer free early pilot:

Build “Akita” — a tailored filing assistant for their firm.

Deliverable: automate 1–2 high-volume filings (e.g., I-130 family petition, I-765 work permit).

Goal: get real-world filing data + testimonial.



---

🚀 Immediate Next Steps

1. Build firm list (20–30 contacts).


2. Draft interview tracker (spreadsheet/Notion).


3. Begin calls + emails.


4. Schedule 3–5 interviews.


5. After glyph focus week, run interviews, then decide first pilot build.

💡 Note: While you’re finishing glyphs + graph RAG for Tekita’s own runtime, this outreach can quietly cook. By the time you’re ready, you’ll already have interviews lined up → no lag between build and client practice.


---

Would you like me to also sketch how to turn their filing system → Graph RAG input schema? That way we already have the bones ready for “Akita for Firms” once you’ve run the first interview.
