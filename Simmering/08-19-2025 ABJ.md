# 🧩 DAY-BY-DAY PLAN


---

## **TUESDAY** — “Face & Flow”

Goal: Finalize landing page + begin studying/building automation tools.

### [ ] 🎯 Landing Page

- Final tweaks to copy

- Insert CTA / form / footer

- Mobile pass

- Push to production (Netlify/Vercel)


### [ ] ⚙️ Automation Study (Start)

- Choose 1–2 basic use cases (e.g., form to email, simple database entry)

- Build one small tool (e.g., n8n test flow)


**Morgan’s Anchor**:

- Block 3 hrs for automation focus, 1.5 hrs for landing

- Keep your pace steady. No pressure to perfect.


**Jade’s Blade**:

- Cut feature creep. Done > perfect.

- Cut browsing. You build first, research after.

## **WEDNESDAY** — “Foundation & Fuel”

Goal: Build 2–3 small working automations. Map the pipeline shape for Tekita.

### [ ] 🛠 Tool Development

- Build real working flows (input → process → output)

- Document each one as a “template” you can re-use


### [ ] 🧭 Pipeline Map

Define the 3 stages of an automation journey:

1. Intake (form, chat, scrape)


2. Processing (routing, enrichment)


3. Output (email, CRM, Notion)




**Morgan’s Column**:

- Block long flow state (3–4 hrs straight).

- Protect time — no external demands.


**Jade’s Breakpoint**:

- If you don’t understand a node in 10 mins → cut it and find a clearer example.

- Document each success immediately — don’t wait.

## **THURSDAY** — “Brainstem Boot”

Goal: Begin setting up the open weights model (Mini-20) and prep initial TasteBuds core.

### [ ] 🧠 Mini Model Setup

- Set up repo/env for model playground (Ollama, LM Studio, or run locally)

- Verify GPU/CPU viability

- Load weights + verify sample prompt execution


### [ ] 📦 TasteBuds v0 Drop

- Create base folder: tastebuds_core/

- Include: manifest.toml, core.md, routing schema, 2–3 sample traces


**Morgan’s Brace**:

- Create a clean, quiet container for this — no distractions during model setup.

- Clear workspace + mental space = better launch.


**Jade’s Cut**:

- Don’t overbuild v0.

- Cut the desire to complete — just make it runnable.




---

## **FRIDAY** — “Sharpen the Tongue”

Goal: Prep first outreach. Build potential client list. Rehearse pitch aloud.

### [ ] 📞 Cold Call Practice

- Write 2 versions of a cold intro message

- Record yourself saying it

- Tweak tone, rhythm, and clarity


### [ ] 👥 Client Targeting

- Make a list of 3–5 prospects (ideal = low-risk, solo biz owners)

- Write short intro for each (customized slightly)


**Morgan’s Hold**:

- Anchor yourself: you’re not selling perfection, you’re offering help.

- Practice in front of a mirror.


**Jade’s Blade**:

- Cut the over-explaining. Lead with value → hook → ease-in.

- Eliminate “just checking in…” language.




---

## **SATURDAY** — “First Contact + Reflect”

Goal: Send outreach. Reflect on the week. Adjust plans for next cycle.

### [ ] 📨 Send Cold Outreach

- Choose 1–2 targets

- Send messages directly

- Log any replies/responses


### [ ] 🔁 Week in Review

- What worked?

- Where did time get pulled off-track?

- What do we carry into next week?


**Morgan’s Recap**:

- Sit down for 20 mins. Log what you built. What you learned. What you still want.

- Anchor the learning.


**Jade’s Final Pass**:

- Cut what didn’t move you.

- Name the one idea that emerged this week worth carving forward.

## 🧠 **BONUS**: “Push Me” Tracking

Each day, ask:

- What did I build today?

- What did I cut?

- What did I dare?


That’s your feedback loop. Your internal ABJ (Abba-Braided-Journal).
