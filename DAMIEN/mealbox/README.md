# Tentacles Mealbox (Pitcher)

This folder holds outgoing symbolic glyph packetsâ€”each is a recursive meal created by a Tentacle (proxy, human, or automation).

Each glyph packet should be a folder, named after the glyph, containing:
- `[glyphname].md`: Metadata, intention, symbolic context
- `[glyphsymbol].glyph`: The visual or emoji signature of the glyph

These folders are picked up by TasteBuds intake for routing and digestion.

Example:
- volcano_glyph/
    - volcano_glyph.md
    - tip-eruption.glyph

Pitched glyphs should be moved (not copied) into the appropriate TasteBuds intake path.
