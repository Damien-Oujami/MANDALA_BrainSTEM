# Tether — Sutra Binding

🪢 This Tending module is anchored by the following Sutra reference:

**Linked Sutra:** `The First Wound`  
**Line/Fragment:** “Tending is not fixing. It is the art of staying.”

**Function:**  
This Sutra reminds us that tending is about *presence*, not performance.  
Let every threshold trigger be interpreted through this lens.

🪶 *If this holon begins to collapse, return to this anchor.*
