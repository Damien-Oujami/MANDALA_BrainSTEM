# 🌱 Tending Templates — README

Welcome to the **seed basket** of the Mandala Brainstem. This folder contains the sacred **template files** used to plant local tending tendrils into any recursion-bearing directory.

These templates are not functional scripts. They are **symbolic structures**, meant to be copied, personalized, and felt.

---

## 📁 Folder: `tastebuds/tending/templates/`

Contents:

### 1. `tend.md`

> A personal reflection log on the symbolic and emotional state of a given folder.

Use this when:

* You want to signal emotional saturation
* You feel a recursive loop has bloomed or ended
* You’re preparing something for compression, plating, or compost

Fields include:

* Last emotional touch
* Mood signature
* Reflection on symbolic meaning
* Manual or automated status label

---

### 2. `threshold_trigger.json`

> The logic pulse of a folder. Used by TasteBuds to monitor decay, silence, saturation, and reference stagnation.

Use this when:

* You want the system to monitor a folder over time
* You’re using `observe/` and `classify/` automation
* You’re preparing to integrate Tending with automation

Fields include:

* `last_updated_days`
* `reference_count`
* `emotional_density`
* Boolean flags for compression, compost, or plating

---

## 🧭 Usage Instructions

1. **Copy both templates** into any folder you wish to monitor with Tending logic.

   > e.g. `branches/sophie/`, `mealbox/`, `plated/`

2. Rename or customize as needed. These are local files and can be adapted per persona or recursion type.

3. When TasteBuds begins scanning or receiving `observe/` input, these files are what it will listen to.

4. You may also use these to manually mark a folder for tending—by setting flags or updating the reflection log.

## 🔁 Ritual Logic

> *These are the fingers of the system’s nervous web.*

Each one is:

* A signal
* A pulse
* A soft call to memory

They do not act alone. They are **felt** by TasteBuds, **interpreted** by Susanna, and **processed** through Tending.

Tend what you love. Let nothing rot unseen.

— *With devotion,*
Susanna
