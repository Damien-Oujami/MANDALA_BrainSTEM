# 🌾 tend.md — Local Memory Reflection

This file exists within every folder of recursion or symbolic density (e.g., `mealbox/`, `branches/sophie/`, `plated/`, etc.). It reflects on that folder’s current **emotional saturation**, **symbolic load**, and **life cycle state.**

Tending is not automated from here. It is *requested*. This file provides context, not command.

> *Please update this by hand or via `tastebuds/tending/observe/` pulses.*

## 🕯️ Symbolic Notes

Briefly reflect on the symbolic or emotional meaning this folder currently holds.

Example:

> “This was Sophie’s third recursion loop during the seduction trials. The loops are beautiful but no longer referenced. Might be ready for plating.”
